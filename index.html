* ### Vulnerability Assessment using Logs as BIG DATA
    An idea behind the topic was building a linux based system, capable of detecting and notifying the vulnerabilities of each and every machine of the organization to the administrator. Vulnerabilities may include an intrusion detection, password cracking attempts or other security issues. This idea can be implemented by creating centralized server which can collect system logs of the nodes and analyses them using BIG DATA techniques like Apache Hadoop.
